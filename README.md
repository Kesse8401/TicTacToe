1. Project info
This project is about creating simple Tic Tac Toe game.
It suppose to:
- enable  two players to have a game
- display information whose turn is is
- mark tiles with "X" or "0"
- acknowledge end of the game by getting one of the winning combinations
- display the result/winner

2. Technology

This project is being created with the use of ES6 and plain JavaScript. I chose plain JavaScript as it allows me to implement all necessary elements mentioned above, and helps me to achieve deeper understanding of the language.

3. Tests

This project does not include any tests, as it structure is fairly simple and including tests would unnecessarily overcomplicate it.
Tests would be added further down the line, as my understanding of ecosystem improves.
