RozpoczÄ™cie projektu.

1. Project info
This project is about creating simple Tic Tac Toe game.
It suppose to:
- enable  two players to have a game
- display information whose turn is is
- mark tiles with "X" or "0"
- acknowledge end of the game by getting one of the winning combinations
- display the result/winner

2. Technology

This project is being created with the use of JavaScript. I chose that language because I can create all elements mentioned above.

3. Tests

This project does not include any tests, as it structure is fairly simple and including tests would unnecessarily overcomplicate it.
