Running the tests

This project does not include any tests, as it structure is fairly simple and including tests would unnecessarily overcomplicate it.
Tests would be added further down the line, as my understanding of the ecosystem improves.


Built With

This project is being created with the use of ES6, plain JavaScript and Node.js. I chose plain JavaScript as it allows me to implement all necessary elements mentioned above, and helps me to achieve deeper understanding of the language.
I used one of npm module- live-server in order to work with HotReload
